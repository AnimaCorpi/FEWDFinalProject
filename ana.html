      <h2>Misson Statement</h2>

<p><strong>Our Ultimate Goal here at Back to Self is to aid the homeless population in readjusting back into society. A common theme among homeless individuals is that they feel almost dehumanized by those around them. People ignore them on the streets, and treat them as if theyre less than. We aim to combat those feelings, and bring them back to the strong, self assured, highly-capable self, we know they are/have the potential to be.</strong></p>
