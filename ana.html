      <h2><u>Mission Statement</u></h2>

<p><strong>Our Ultimate Goal here at Back to Self is to aid the homeless population in readjusting back into society. A common theme among homeless individuals is that they feel almost dehumanized by those around them. People ignore them on the streets, and treat them as if theyre less than. We aim to combat those feelings, and bring them back to the strong, self assured, highly-capable self, we know they are/have the potential to be.</strong></p>

                    Our main focus is on helping homeless youth, and Veterans, but that is not an exhaustive list. We help all homeless, and persons facing housing instability. We have plenty of services to help low-income families and individuals. Some of those services include, but are not limited to: Education Services, Job Training, Health Services, etc.
